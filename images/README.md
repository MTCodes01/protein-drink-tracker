# Images for Protein Drink Tracker

Add your own pictures here so the app can switch between them when you toggle.

| File | When it shows |
|------|----------------|
| **drank.jpg** | Toggled **on** – e.g. Arnold Schwarzenegger (flexed/strong). Shown when you’ve drunk your protein today. |
| **not-drank.jpg** | Toggled **off** – e.g. a relaxed or “weak” image. Shown when you haven’t yet. |

- Use **drank.jpg** and **not-drank.jpg** (or use **drank.png** / **not-drank.png** and update the `src` in `index.html`).
- Square or portrait photos work best; they’re cropped to fit with `object-fit: cover`.
